- Use ripgrep instead of grep for searching
- Do not use conventional commit syntax, keep commits concise and informative, the classification of the work like that is unnecessary
- When creating a plan, always write the contents to plan.md in the root of the current repo
- When making PRs, if the branch name has ME-# in it, use that as the PR title "ME-# : <description>" 
    - Always open the PR in draft
    - Additionally, only provide an overview and list of changes, do not mention testing or individual file changes
