- Use ripgrep instead of grep for searching
- When creating a plan, always write the contents to plan.md in the root of the current repo
- Do not use conventional commit syntax, keep commits concise and informative, the classification of the work like that is unnecessary.
- You'll usually have access to tmux sessions, typically named `backend` and `frontend`, you can always tmux ls to see what's available though.
